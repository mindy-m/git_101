### If a Goat is your friend, you are a lucky person!

If you are lucky enough to have a Goat for a friend, they may bake you a pie! Make sure to provide your goat friend with plenty of raw ingredients, and the fresher, the better!

Goats like to cook with:

- Blueberries
- Apples
- Broccoli
- Apple sauce
- Garlic
- Onions


#### If a Goat bakes you a Broccoli pie...

You should feel extremely honored. Do you like Broccoli? No? DO NOT LET THEM KNOW THIS. Goats LOVE Broccoli, and to reject a Broccoli pie would insult them heavily! If you like Broccoli, then you are in good luck! If you do not... accept the pie, and then feed it to another Goat, who will see this as a great honor from you.
